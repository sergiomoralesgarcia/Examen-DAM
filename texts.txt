What Is An AI Model?

AI or Artificial Intelligence is a subfield within computer science associated with constructing 
machines that can simulate human intelligence.

An AI model is a program or algorithm that utilizes a set of data that enables it to recognize certain 
patterns. This allows it to reach a conclusion or make a prediction when provided with sufficient information.

This is especially useful for solving complex problems using huge amounts of data with high accuracy and minimum costs. 

Machine Learning is a subset within AI associated with providing machines the ability to learn from experience without the need 
to be programmed explicitly, so in a nutshell, ML or machine learning is a part of AI.
